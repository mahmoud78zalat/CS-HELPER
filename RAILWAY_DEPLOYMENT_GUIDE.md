# Railway.app Deployment Guide - BFL Customer Service Helper

## Quick Fix for Current Issue

Your deployment is failing because the application requires Supabase environment variables to be set in Railway. Here's how to fix it:

### 1. Set Environment Variables in Railway Dashboard

Go to your Railway project dashboard and add these environment variables:

**Required Supabase Variables:**
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
SESSION_SECRET=your_random_session_secret
```

**How to get Supabase credentials:**
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create/access your project
2. Go to Settings â†’ API
3. Copy your Project URL (VITE_SUPABASE_URL)
4. Copy your anon/public key (VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY) 
5. Copy your service_role key (SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY)

**Session Secret:**
Generate a random 32+ character string for SESSION_SECRET:
```bash
# You can generate one with:
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

### 2. Deploy Process

1. **Push your code to GitHub** (if not already done)
2. **Connect Railway to your GitHub repo**
3. **Set the environment variables** in Railway dashboard
4. **Deploy** - Railway will automatically use the Dockerfile

### 3. Troubleshooting

**If you see "ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE":**
- This is fixed in the updated Dockerfile which now uses npm instead of pnpm
- Make sure you're using the latest Dockerfile from this project

**If you see "executable node_env=production could not be found":**
- This is fixed in the updated railway.json which removes conflicting start commands
- The Dockerfile now handles the start command properly

**If you see "vite: not found" or "esbuild: not found" during build:**
- This is fixed in the updated Dockerfile which now uses `npx vite` and `npx esbuild` commands
- Make sure you're using the latest Dockerfile that includes the npx prefixes

**If health checks fail:**
- Ensure all Supabase environment variables are set correctly
- Check Railway logs for specific error messages
- The app will start on port 8080 as configured

### 4. Railway-Specific Files

These files are configured for Railway deployment:
- `Dockerfile` - Uses npm and Node.js 20
- `railway.json` - Railway configuration with health checks
- `.dockerignore` - Excludes pnpm files to prevent conflicts

## Complete Deployment Steps

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Supabase project set up with database tables
   - GitHub repository with your code
   - Railway account

2. **Railway Setup:**
   - Create new project in Railway
   - Connect to your GitHub repository
   - Railway will auto-detect the Dockerfile

3. **Environment Configuration:**
   Set all required environment variables in Railway dashboard:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...your-anon-key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...your-service-role-key
   SESSION_SECRET=your-random-32-char-secret
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=8080
   ```

4. **Deploy:**
   - Railway will automatically build and deploy
   - Health check endpoint: `/api/health`
   - App will be available at your Railway domain

## Database Setup

Your Supabase database should have these tables (they'll be created automatically when the app starts):
- users
- live_reply_templates  
- email_templates
- live_reply_usage
- email_template_usage
- site_content
- sessions

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Railway deployment logs
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure Supabase project is accessible
4. Check that your Supabase database URL is correct

The application is now configured to work properly with Railway's deployment system using npm instead of pnpm.

## LATEST BUILD FIXES (July 30, 2025)

**Railway Build Failure Resolution:**
- **Created `vite.config.railway.ts`**: Railway-specific Vite configuration that excludes Replit plugins causing build failures
- **Updated Dockerfile**: Uses Railway-optimized build command with proper dependency externalization
- **Enhanced nixpacks.toml**: Alternative build configuration for Railway using Nixpacks instead of Docker

**Build Process Now:**
```bash
NODE_ENV=production npx vite build --config vite.config.railway.ts
npx esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist --external:@replit/* --external:pg-native --external:cpu-features
```

**Files Added/Modified:**
- `vite.config.railway.ts` - Railway-specific build config
- `Dockerfile` - Updated build commands
- `nixpacks.toml` - Alternative build configuration

The Railway build process now successfully handles the Replit development environment dependencies and creates clean production builds for deployment.

## FINAL DEPLOYMENT FIX (July 30, 2025)

**"executable node_env=production could not be found" ERROR RESOLVED:**
- **Root cause**: The `npm start` command in package.json contains `NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js` which Railway interprets as trying to execute an executable called `node_env=production`
- **Solution**: Created `railway-start.js` startup script that sets environment variables programmatically instead of through shell commands
- **Fixed deployment**: Railway now executes `node railway-start.js` which properly sets NODE_ENV and imports the application

**Updated files**:
- `railway-start.js`: New Railway-specific startup script (created)
- `nixpacks.toml`: Updated start command to use railway-start.js
- `Dockerfile`: Updated CMD to use railway-start.js
- Removed environment variable declarations from build configs

Environment variables must be set in Railway dashboard:
```
PORT=8080
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_key
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
```

**Note**: `NODE_ENV=production` is now set automatically by the `railway-start.js` script, so you don't need to set it in the Railway dashboard.
