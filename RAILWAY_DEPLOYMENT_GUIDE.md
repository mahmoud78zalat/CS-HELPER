# Railway.app Deployment Guide

## Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Prerequisites
- GitHub repository with your code
- Supabase project with credentials
- Railway.app account

### 2. Environment Variables (Required)
Set these in Railway dashboard under Variables:

**Supabase Configuration:**
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
```

**Session Configuration:**
```
SESSION_SECRET=your_random_32_character_string
```

**Railway Configuration (automatically set):**
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8080
```

### 3. Deploy to Railway

1. **Connect Repository**
   - Go to Railway.app dashboard
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your repository

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Go to Variables tab in Railway dashboard
   - Add all the required environment variables listed above
   - Railway will automatically detect the `railway.json` configuration

3. **Deploy**
   - Railway will automatically build using the Dockerfile
   - Health checks will run against `/api/health`
   - Build takes ~2-3 minutes, health checks may take 2-5 minutes

### 4. Troubleshooting

**Health Check Failures:**
- Ensure all Supabase environment variables are set correctly
- Check that SESSION_SECRET is a secure random string (32+ characters)
- Verify your Supabase project is active and accessible

**Build Failures:**
- Check the build logs for specific error messages
- Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
- Verify the build command works locally with `npm run build`

**Application Not Starting:**
- Check the deploy logs for runtime errors
- Verify environment variables are set in Railway dashboard
- Test the health endpoint locally: `curl http://localhost:8080/api/health`

### 5. Configuration Files

The following files are configured for Railway deployment:

- **`railway.json`** - Railway-specific configuration
- **`Dockerfile`** - Container build instructions  
- **`package.json`** - Build and start scripts
- **Health Check** - Available at `/api/health`

### 6. Post-Deployment

1. **Test Health Check**
   - Visit `https://your-app.railway.app/api/health`
   - Should return: `{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"...","environment":"production",...}`

2. **Test Application**
   - Visit your Railway app URL
   - Log in with your Supabase credentials
   - Verify all features work correctly

3. **Monitor Logs**
   - Check Railway logs for any runtime errors
   - Monitor performance and response times
