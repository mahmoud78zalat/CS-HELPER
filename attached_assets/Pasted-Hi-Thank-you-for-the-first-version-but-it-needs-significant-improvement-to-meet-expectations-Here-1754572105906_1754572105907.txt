Hi! Thank you for the first version, but it needs significant improvement to meet expectations. Here's exactly what needs to be done:

❌ Issues in Current Version:
Animations are not smooth or expressive — they feel too basic, unrealistic, or choppy.

The Yeti mascot is not lively or cute enough — it should be fun, expressive, and cartoonish.

The login form placement is off — it needs to be perfectly centered on the screen, and feel like it's part of the Yeti's pose.

The Yeti holding the sign effect is not clear — it should actually look like the Yeti is grabbing and lifting a sign, not just floating beside or behind it.

✅ What You Need to Do:
🔍 1. Study Existing High-Quality Projects:
Before coding further, please search online for existing animations or projects that already implement this behavior well. Here are some example sources you must check:

Codrops: https://tympanus.net/codrops/2019/01/07/how-to-animate-a-login-mascot/

CodePen: search for “Login form mascot eye tracking” or “Yeti login animation”

GitHub examples (e.g., malven/interactive-login-form)

Use these as direct references and visual guides to recreate accurate, interactive behavior.

🛠️ 2. Improve Animations:
Use GSAP or Lottie to animate the Yeti's eyes, arms, smile/frown, etc.

The eyes should smoothly follow the cursor (with easing).

When focusing the password field, the Yeti should cover its eyes smoothly and realistically.

On login success, play a short happy animation (bounce, wave, smile) and delay the redirect by 2 seconds.

On failure, play a sad animation (shake head, frown, etc.).

🎨 3. Visual Fixes:
Move the login form to the center of the screen, and make it look like a sign the Yeti is holding.

The Yeti’s hands must visibly grip or rest on the sign — the illusion should be clear.

The background and layout must be responsive and clean on all screen sizes.

🔁 Summary:
Please review high-quality examples online first, and then rebuild the layout and animation with smoother transitions, better Yeti art, and proper positioning.
