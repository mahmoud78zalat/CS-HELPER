✓ Fixed layout spacing issues - right panel now 480px wide for better variable visibility
✓ Compressed variable input sections with smaller padding and text sizes to fit more variables
✓ Enhanced middle email preview area to use full available height with proper flex layout
✓ Implemented drag-and-drop functionality for variables into email body
✓ Fixed import errors and type definitions for proper compilation

Can you test the email composer now? The variable area should have much more room and the layout should use space more efficiently.

still the Live Template Variables cramped can you just make it resizeable by expanding it with mouse ? and it should respect the screen aspect for auto resization when template is selected also and about categories in my site kindly make the genres are linked to each categorie so the genres wouldnt be indivual at all it must be related to a specific genre kindly update that at admin panel Template Configuration Manager
make the categories & genres connected

I'll make the Live Template Variables area resizable and connect categories with genres in the admin panel. Let me implement both improvements.


Opened client/src/components/EmailComposerModalNew.tsx

Searched for "Find admin panel template configuration components for managing categories and genres"
Now I'll implement both requested improvements: 1) Make the variable area resizable and 2) Connect categories and genres in the admin panel. Let me start with making the email composer variable area resizable using react-resizable-panels:


Edited client/src/components/EmailComposerModalNew.tsx

Edited client/src/components/EmailComposerModalNew.tsx
Now let me fix the LSP errors and then work on connecting categories and genres in the admin panel. First, let me address the DraggableVariable component errors:


Opened client/src/components/DraggableVariable.tsx

Edited client/src/components/EmailComposerModalNew.tsx

Edited client/src/components/EmailComposerModalNew.tsx
I need to fix the DraggableVariable component interface. Let me create a simple span-based solution for now and then work on connecting categories with genres:


Edited client/src/components/EmailComposerModalNew.tsx

Edited client/src/components/EmailComposerModalNew.tsx
Optimized Agent memory
Now I need to work on connecting categories and genres in the admin panel. First, let me update the database schema to support this relationship:


Opened shared/schema.ts

Opened server/supabase-storage.ts
Now I need to create a schema to connect categories and genres, then update the admin panel to manage this relationship. Let me first add the necessary tables:


Opened shared/schema.ts
Let me view the personal notes section first to see the exact format:


Opened shared/schema.ts
Let me search for the personal notes table to find its exact location:


Searched for "Find personal notes table definition in schema"
Now I'll add the category and genre tables directly after the personal notes table, and also add their relationships and insert schemas:


Edited shared/schema.ts

Restarted Start application
Now let me push the database schema changes and create the API endpoints for managing the connected categories and genres:


Executed cd . && npm run db:push

Opened server/supabase-storage.ts
I need to directly add the storage methods to support the connected categories and genres. Let me add the methods for managing template categories and genres with their relationships:

Let me add the necessary storage methods for managing connected categories and genres. I'll add them at the end of the file:


Opened server/supabase-storage.ts

Edited server/supabase-storage.ts
Now let me add the API routes for the connected categories and genres, and then create a template configuration modal in the admin panel:

Optimized Agent memory
Let me search for the exact format of the template genres API route:


Searched for "Find template genres API route in simple routes"
Let me add the connected categories API routes directly to the simple routes file:


Edited server/simple-routes.ts
Now let me create a Template Configuration Manager component for the admin panel to manage connected categories and genres:


Created client/src/components/TemplateConfigurationManager.tsx
Now let me add the Template Configuration Manager to the Admin Panel and check for any LSP errors:


Opened client/src/components/AdminPanel.tsx
I need to fix the LSP errors by adding the methods to the storage interface first. Let me check the IStorage interface and add the missing methods:


Opened server/storage.ts
Let me search for the template variable operations in the storage interface to find the correct location:
