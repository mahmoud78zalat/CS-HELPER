❗ 1. Acknowledgment Sync Failure
Users are seeing:
"Your acknowledgment was saved but couldn't sync to the server."

✅ Fix:

Ensure that after clicking “Got it”:

The acknowledgment is properly inserted into the user_announcement_acks table via Supabase

If the API call fails, retry at least once or show a proper error and fallback to localStorage

Confirm the Supabase insert permissions and RLS policies are correctly allowing authenticated users to insert their own acknowledgment

❗ 2. Announcement Creation Fails
Error shown:
"Error creating announcement. You can check the logs yourself."

✅ Fix:

Double-check:

The announcement form fields (title, content, colors, created_by) are properly validated before submission

The insert request is being sent to Supabase correctly with all required fields

If using an auth user ID for created_by, ensure the user session is available at time of request

Add feedback to admin when saving:

"Saving..." → "Announcement created successfully ✅" or "Failed ❌"

✳️ 3. Add Re-announce Functionality
✅ New Feature:

Add a button in the admin UI: "Re-announce"

When clicked:

Update the updated_at timestamp or increment a version field

This forces the announcement to show again for all users, even those who already clicked “Got it”

✅ Frontend Behavior:

Store acknowledged_at or a version in localStorage

If announcement updated_at or version is newer than local value, show the modal again

🚀 4. Force Show Active Announcement on Login / Refresh
✅ Make sure:

If any announcement is:

is_active = true

Not yet acknowledged or re-announced,
→ It must be shown on next login, refresh, or route change — immediately

Don't wait for user to navigate or click — force the modal to open with animation

💡 Summary of Required Logic:
Feature	Required Behavior
"Got it" clicked	Save to localStorage + Supabase, hide modal
Acknowledged announcement	Should not be shown again unless re-announced
Re-announce clicked	Bump version or timestamp → force modal to show for everyone again
New or active announcement	Must show on next load immediately for all users
Creation failure	Fix insert validation + show error or success messages
Acknowledgment failure	Fix Supabase write + allow retry / fallback with clear messaging
