../dist/public/index.html                   3.71 kB │ gzip:   1.27 kB
../dist/public/assets/index-BUWAogM4.css  107.79 kB │ gzip:  16.82 kB

../dist/public/assets/index-CWgb4isA.js   640.78 kB │ gzip: 183.88 kB


(!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification. Consider:
- Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
- Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
- Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.
