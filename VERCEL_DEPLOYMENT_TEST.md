# VERCEL DEPLOYMENT - SUPABASE CONNECTION TEST

## Steps to Test Your Vercel Deployment

### 1. Redeploy After Setting Environment Variables
**CRITICAL**: Environment variables only take effect after redeployment.

In your Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
3. Wait for deployment to complete

### 2. Test Supabase Connection

Visit your deployed Vercel URL and:

**Option A: Check Browser Console**
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Look for console logs that show:
   ```
   [SupabaseStorage] Environment check:
   [SupabaseStorage] NODE_ENV: production
   [SupabaseStorage] All env vars: ["SUPABASE_URL", "VITE_SUPABASE_URL", ...]
   ```

**Option B: Test Login**
1. Try to login with your Supabase credentials
2. If it works → Supabase is connected
3. If it fails → Check environment variables

**Option C: Check Network Tab**
1. Open Network tab in browser tools
2. Look for API calls to `/api/user/` or `/api/templates`
3. If they return data → Supabase is working
4. If they return errors → Environment issue

### 3. Quick Fix if Still Not Working

If your deployment is still using memory storage:

**Add these additional environment variables in Vercel:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://lafldimdrginjqloihbh.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix ensures they're available at build time.

### 4. Expected Results

**Working Deployment Should Show:**
- ✅ Login page with Supabase Auth
- ✅ Templates loading from your database
- ✅ User data from Supabase
- ✅ Admin panel with real analytics

**If Still Using Memory Storage:**
- ❌ No login functionality
- ❌ Empty templates/users
- ❌ Basic interface only

### 5. Debugging

If issues persist, check your Vercel deployment logs:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard → Functions tab
2. Look for error messages about missing environment variables
3. Check if `[SupabaseStorage]` logs appear

The enhanced logging I added will show exactly which environment variables are being found.
