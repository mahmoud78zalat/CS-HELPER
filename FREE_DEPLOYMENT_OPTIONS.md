## 💡 **Split Deployment Strategy**

**Frontend-only on Netlify (FREE):**
Your React app can connect directly to Supabase without needing a backend server for most operations.

**What Works Without Backend:**
- ✅ User authentication (Supabase Auth)
- ✅ Template management (direct Supabase calls)
- ✅ Real-time features (Supabase realtime)
- ✅ All CRUD operations

**What Needs Backend:**
- ❌ Complex API logic
- ❌ Server-side validation
- ❌ Background tasks
