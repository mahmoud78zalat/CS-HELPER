# Database Issue Diagnosis - Templates Not Loading in Vercel

## 🔍 Problem Analysis

Your Vercel deployment shows:
- ✅ **Users fetch correctly** (authentication working)
- ❌ **Templates and other tables don't fetch** (database queries failing)

This is a **Supabase RLS (Row Level Security)** and **API routing** issue, not an environment variable problem.

## 🎯 Root Cause

The issue is likely one of these:

### 1. **Supabase RLS Policies**
- User table has proper RLS policies allowing read access
- Template tables might have restrictive RLS policies
- In production, RLS is enforced more strictly

### 2. **API Route Configuration**
- Templates API might not be properly routed in Vercel serverless functions
- Different endpoints responding differently in production

### 3. **Authentication Context**
- User authentication works but doesn't carry over to template queries
- Service role key might not be used for template operations

## 🔧 Immediate Fixes Needed

### Fix 1: Update Vercel API Entry Point
The current `/api/index.ts` might not be routing all endpoints correctly.

### Fix 2: Supabase RLS Policy Check
Need to verify template table policies allow read access.

### Fix 3: Enhanced Debugging
Add production-specific logging to identify exact failure points.

## 🚀 Testing Strategy

1. Deploy with enhanced logging
2. Test individual API endpoints
3. Check Vercel function logs
4. Verify Supabase RLS policies
5. Confirm service role key usage

This analysis will pinpoint the exact cause of the template loading failure.
