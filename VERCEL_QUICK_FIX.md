# VERCEL DEPLOYMENT - QUICK FIX (July 26, 2025)

## Problem Solved
**Error**: "Function Runtimes must have a valid version"

## Solution Applied
Simplified `vercel.json` to remove problematic functions configuration since the project uses a custom build process.

## New vercel.json (Copy this exactly)

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Why This Works
1. **Custom Build Process**: Your build.sh script handles everything (frontend + server)
2. **Static Output**: Generates static files in dist/public for hosting
3. **SPA Routing**: Fallback to index.html handles React Router navigation
4. **No Serverless Functions**: Removes problematic runtime configuration

## Files to Copy from Replit Project

**Copy these 3 files from your current Replit project to GitHub:**

1. **vercel.json** (root) - Contains the simplified configuration above
2. **client/index.html** - Has the required HTML title tag  
3. **server/memory-storage.ts** - Has TypeScript compilation fixes

## Deployment Steps
1. Copy the 3 files above to your GitHub repository
2. Commit and push changes
3. Vercel will automatically deploy successfully

## Expected Result
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ No more runtime version errors
- ✅ SPA routing works (no 404 errors)
- ✅ Static hosting on Vercel

This configuration treats your app as a static site with SPA routing, which is exactly what you need.
