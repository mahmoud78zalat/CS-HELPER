# BFL Customer Service Helper - System Architecture

## Overview

This is a comprehensive customer service management tool for "Brands For Less" (BFL) built as an internal platform for customer service agents. The system helps agents manage customer information, create internal team communications, and streamline support operations through email templates and centralized data management.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Admin should have overpowered capabilities and enhanced control over all templates and system features.
Fix all bugs and ensure dropdown components work correctly.
Extensive template genres including greeting, CSAT, warning abusive language, apology, thank you, farewell, confirmation, technical support, and holiday/special occasion.
Development mode: Authentication streamlined with auto-admin access for development purposes.

**Template System Requirements (January 2025)**:
- Live reply templates for direct customer chat interactions
- Email templates for internal team escalations and communication
- Supabase integration ready - all admin panel changes should sync when configured
- Clear separation between customer-facing and internal communication templates

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite for development
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom BFL brand colors

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Provider**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect
- **Session Management**: Express sessions stored in PostgreSQL
- **Role-based Access**: Two roles (admin, agent) with different permissions
- **User Status**: Active/blocked/banned status management
- **Online Presence**: Real-time user status tracking via WebSocket

## Key Components

### Database Schema
1. **Users Table**: Stores user profiles with roles, status, and presence data

### Dual Template System (Updated January 2025)
**Live Reply Templates** - For direct customer interactions in live chat:
- Quick copy-to-clipboard functionality for instant responses
- Variable substitution (customer_name, order_id, time_frame, etc.)
- Category-based organization (Orders, General, Apology, Technical)
- Usage tracking and analytics for optimization
- No subject line (chat-focused content only)

**Email Templates** - For internal team communication:

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Replit Auth → Session creation → Role-based access control
2. **Customer Data Management**: Local storage → Persistent across sessions → Template variable source
3. **Template Processing**: Template selection → Variable replacement → Copy to clipboard
4. **Admin Operations**: Role verification → Database operations → Real-time updates
5. **WebSocket Communication**: Connection establishment → User presence → Status broadcasting
