## Recent Changes

### Bug Fix: Email Template Deletion Error (August 2, 2025)
Fixed the "unable to remove email template please try again" error that occurred when deleting email templates. The issue was caused by:

**Root Cause**: Silent failures in Supabase deletion operations. When the Supabase `deleteTemplate` method failed, it returned `false` instead of throwing an error, causing:
- Local database deletion to proceed successfully
- Supabase records to remain intact
- Database inconsistency between local and remote data
- Generic error messages displayed to users

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Enhanced Error Handling in Supabase Layer**: Modified `server/supabase.ts` to throw detailed errors when deletion fails instead of silently returning false
2. **Fail-Fast Deletion Strategy**: Updated `server/storage.ts` to delete from Supabase first, ensuring consistency
3. **Comprehensive Logging**: Added detailed logging throughout the deletion process for better debugging
4. **Schema Cleanup**: Removed references to non-existent fields (`createdBy`, `updatedBy`) that were causing LSP errors

The deletion process now follows a fail-fast approach: if Supabase deletion fails, the entire operation fails, maintaining data consistency between local and remote databases.
