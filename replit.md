# BFL Customer Service Helper - System Architecture

## Overview

This is a comprehensive customer service management tool for "Brands For Less" (BFL) built as an internal platform for customer service agents. The system helps agents manage customer information, create internal team communications, and streamline support operations through email templates and centralized data management.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Admin should have overpowered capabilities and enhanced control over all templates and system features.
Fix all bugs and ensure dropdown components work correctly.
Extensive template genres including greeting, CSAT, warning abusive language, apology, thank you, farewell, confirmation, technical support, and holiday/special occasion.
Development mode: Authentication streamlined with auto-admin access for development purposes.

**Template System Requirements (January 2025)**:
- Live reply templates for direct customer chat interactions
- Email templates for internal team escalations and communication
- Supabase integration ready - all admin panel changes should sync when configured
- Clear separation between customer-facing and internal communication templates

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite for development
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom BFL brand colors

- **Role-based Access**: Two roles (admin, agent) with different permissions
- **User Status**: Active/blocked/banned status management
- **Online Presence**: Real-time user status tracking via WebSocket

## Key Components

### Database Schema
1. **Users Table**: Stores user profiles with roles, status, and presence data
2. **Live Reply Templates Table**: Quick responses for customer live chat interactions
3. **Email Templates Table**: Internal team communication for escalations and requests  
4. **Live Reply Usage Table**: Tracks live chat template usage statistics
5. **Email Template Usage Table**: Tracks internal email template usage statistics
6. **Site Content Table**: Dynamic content management for customizable elements
7. **Sessions Table**: Secure session storage for authentication

**Supabase Integration**: All tables include `supabase_id` and `last_synced_at` fields for automatic synchronization when Supabase is configured.

### Enhanced Admin Panel Features (Latest Update)

### Dual Template System (Updated January 2025)
**Live Reply Templates** - For direct customer interactions in live chat:
- Quick copy-to-clipboard functionality for instant responses
- Variable substitution (customer_name, order_id, time_frame, etc.)
- Category-based organization (Orders, General, Apology, Technical)
- Usage tracking and analytics for optimization
- No subject line (chat-focused content only)

**Email Templates** - For internal team communication:
- Subject + body content with variable support
