## Recent Changes

### Comprehensive Real-Time Updates Implementation (August 2, 2025)
Successfully implemented complete real-time update functionality across the entire admin panel system without requiring page refresh or panel reopening.

**Enhancement Overview**: The system now provides true real-time synchronization using WebSocket-based communication through Supabase channels for all CRUD operations.

**Implementation Details**:
1. **Real-Time Service Enhancement**: Expanded `client/src/lib/realTimeService.ts` with broadcast functions for all entity types:
   - Templates (live reply templates)
   - Email templates 
   - Announcements
   - Users and role changes
   - Groups, categories, and genres
   - FAQs and variables

2. **Comprehensive Mutation Broadcasting**: Added real-time broadcast calls to all AdminPanel mutations:
   - Template creation, updating, and deletion
   - Email template creation, updating, and deletion
   - Announcement creation, deletion, and re-announcement
   - User role changes and deletion
   - Group creation and updating

3. **Real-Time Update Hook**: The existing `useRealTimeUpdates` hook automatically listens for all broadcast events and triggers cache invalidation for affected data.

**User Experience Impact**: 
- All admin panel changes now reflect immediately across all connected user sessions
- No manual refresh required for any admin operations
- Consistent data state maintained across multiple administrators
- Enhanced collaborative workflow for admin teams

### Bug Fix: Email Template Deletion Error (August 2, 2025)
Fixed the "unable to remove email template please try again" error that occurred when deleting email templates. The issue was caused by:

**Root Cause**: Silent failures in Supabase deletion operations. When the Supabase `deleteTemplate` method failed, it returned `false` instead of throwing an error, causing:
- Local database deletion to proceed successfully
- Supabase records to remain intact
- Database inconsistency between local and remote data
- Generic error messages displayed to users

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Enhanced Error Handling in Supabase Layer**: Modified `server/supabase.ts` to throw detailed errors when deletion fails instead of silently returning false
2. **Fail-Fast Deletion Strategy**: Updated `server/storage.ts` to delete from Supabase first, ensuring consistency
3. **Comprehensive Logging**: Added detailed logging throughout the deletion process for better debugging
4. **Schema Cleanup**: Removed references to non-existent fields (`createdBy`, `updatedBy`) that were causing LSP errors

The deletion process now follows a fail-fast approach: if Supabase deletion fails, the entire operation fails, maintaining data consistency between local and remote databases.

### Enhanced Online/Offline Detection & Notes UI Improvements (August 6, 2025)

   - Offline threshold: 90 seconds for reliable detection
2. **Enhanced Presence Tracking**: Improved page visibility change detection and connection reliability
3. **Robust Authentication**: Fixed server-side middleware and presence monitoring issues
4. **Activity Detection**: Better handling of page refresh and reconnection scenarios
