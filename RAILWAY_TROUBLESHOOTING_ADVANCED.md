# Railway Deployment - Advanced Troubleshooting

## Current Issue: Health Check Failures Despite Environment Variables

**Status:** Railway build succeeds but health check fails with "service unavailable"

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Environment Variables:** ‚úÖ Set correctly in Railway dashboard
2. **Build Process:** ‚úÖ Completes successfully 
3. **Startup Issue:** ‚ùå Application not starting properly

### Debugging Steps

**Check Deploy Logs in Railway:**
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your project ‚Üí Deployments 
3. Click "Deploy Logs" tab (not Build Logs)
4. Look for startup errors

**Common Startup Issues:**

1. **PORT Configuration:**
   - Railway expects app to bind to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`
   - Your app should use Railway's PORT environment variable

2. **Environment Variable Access:**
   - Check if Supabase variables are properly loaded at runtime
   - Verify NODE_ENV is set to "production"

3. **Database Connection:**
   - Supabase connection might timeout during startup
   - Health check fails if Supabase is unreachable

### Quick Fixes to Try

**Option 1: Force Railway to Use Correct Startup**
- Railway now has `nixpacks.toml` configuration
- Specifies exact startup command and environment

**Option 2: Check Deploy Logs**
- Look for these error patterns in Deploy Logs:
  ```
  Error: Missing or empty Supabase credentials
  EADDRINUSE: port already in use
  Connection timeout to Supabase
  ```

**Option 3: Test Environment Variables**
- In Railway dashboard, temporarily add a debug variable:
  ```
  DEBUG_STARTUP=true
  ```
- This will show more detailed startup logging

### Expected Deploy Log Output

**Successful startup should show:**
```
[SupabaseStorage] ‚úÖ Successfully connected to Supabase
[Storage] ‚úÖ Using Supabase storage
üåê Render Environment Configuration:
   NODE_ENV: production
   PORT: 8080
   Database: Supabase
[express] serving on port 8080
```

**Failed startup might show:**
```
[Storage] Failed to initialize Supabase storage: Error: Missing or empty Supabase credentials
```

### Next Steps

1. **Check Deploy Logs** - This will reveal the exact error
2. **Verify Environment Variables** - Ensure they're exactly as specified
3. **Test Supabase Connection** - Verify your Supabase project is accessible
4. **Check Railway Region** - Ensure it can reach your Supabase region

The application code is working (as evidenced by successful local testing), so this is purely a deployment configuration issue that the Deploy Logs will reveal.
