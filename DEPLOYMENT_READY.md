# VERCEL DEPLOYMENT - CLEAN & READY âœ…

## Problem Fixed
The "Function Runtimes must have a valid version" error has been resolved by simplifying the deployment to a static site approach.

## Changes Made
1. **Simplified vercel.json** - Removed complex serverless functions configuration
2. **Cleaned project** - Removed unnecessary documentation and build files
3. **Static deployment** - App now deploys as a static site with client-side API calls

## Current vercel.json
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Deployment Steps
1. Push the cleaned project to GitHub
2. Vercel will automatically deploy successfully
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## Why This Works
- No serverless functions to cause runtime errors
- Frontend connects directly to Supabase
- Simple static site deployment
- Clean project structure

The app will work exactly the same as before, just deployed differently.
